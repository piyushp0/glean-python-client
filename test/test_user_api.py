    Glean Client API

    # Introduction These are the public APIs to enable implementing a custom client interface to the Glean system.  # Usage guidelines This API is evolving fast. Glean will provide advance notice of any planned backwards incompatible changes along with a 6-month sunset period for anything that requires developers to adopt the new versions.  # SDK Client bindings for the API can be generated for most popular languages (Python, Java, NodeJS, etc). To do so:  Download the OpenAPI specification for the API, by clicking on one of the following options: 1. [Download JSON specification](https://api.redocly.com/registry/bundle/glean/Glean%20Client%20API%20SDK%20source/v1/openapi.json?branch=main&download=true) 2. [Download YAML specification](https://api.redocly.com/registry/bundle/glean/Glean%20Client%20API%20SDK%20source/v1/openapi.yaml?branch=main&download=true)  Use [openapi-generator-cli](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-cli) to generate bindings for your language of choice, for example: ```bash shell $ npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@latest generate -i client_api.yaml -g go ```  To see available languages: ```bash shell $ npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@latest list ```  Determine the host you need to connect to. This will be the URL of the backend for your Glean deployment, for example, customer-be.glean.com 

    The version of the OpenAPI document: 0.9.0
